## Project Status

This project is live but also currently in development phase. At this current stage, this project is an HTML/CSS layout with limited backend functionality. This website features a full-screen image media fade and embedded promotional videos on the Home page as well as links to social media and the contact form. This website is mobile friendly and features a side drawer navigation section for smaller screen sizes.

## Technologies

Built with React, this is a great example of a small business website solution that separates this business from the cookie cutter DIY website templates. Libraries and tools utilized for this project include styling with TailwindCSS and Styled Components, Video-React player and icons from React-Icons.

## Future Development

In a future release, this project will include components that will utilize backend calls to the TripAdviser API for data on vacation destionation pricing and reviews. Also scheduled for development is a blog section that the client can maintain and update without the help of a developer.
